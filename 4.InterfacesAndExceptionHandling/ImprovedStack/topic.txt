Interface stack with push and pop
2 classes Static Array and Dynamic Array
Access this using INTERFACE type reference and not just Class type like
Interface intObj= new Class();


Also classes in different files declared default or public are accessible 
in the same folder. Default package much ? It works= I'm happy.
Ignorance is bliss.
